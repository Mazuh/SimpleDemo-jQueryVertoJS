# Simple Demonstration
## jQuery Verto JS

Simple demonstration of the jQuery Verto JS free source lib, making a video conference through a FreeSWITCH server.

I'm usually using it for testing and debugging, since it's so simple.

### Setting up locally

Easier way for a Unix-based system.
Assuming that you have a `python` 2.7.X, run this
command line inside the repository directory:

```sh
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

Use your web browser to access the address and port told by
your `stdout`.

Without a server exposing those files, you'll have trouble
with user media permissions.

### Legal

This project should be only a running example. Easy but unofficial.
Also not a safe hub for downloading the Verto.

Verto lib and the FreeSWITCH itself, check the official repo:

Read the lib documentation too (from where I learn how to make
this whole example): https://evoluxbr.github.io/verto-docs/
